I'm a third-year undergraduate student from [School of Mathematical Sciences, Nankai University](https://math.nankai.edu.cn/). 
My research interests include the Image inverse problem, Basic theories and algorithms in deep learning.


I am very fortunate to be advised by  [Prof. Wu Chunlin](https://math.nankai.edu.cn/2023/1211/c34830a531300/page.htm) from [School of Mathematical Sciences, Nankai University](https://math.nankai.edu.cn/).
