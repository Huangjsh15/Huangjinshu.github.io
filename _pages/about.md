I'm a third-year Ph.D. student at the [School of Mathematical Sciences, Nankai University](https://math.nankai.edu.cn/). 
My research interests include image inverse problems as well as fundamental theories and algorithms in deep learning.


I am very fortunate to be advised by  [Prof. Wu Chunlin](https://math.nankai.edu.cn/2023/1211/c34830a531300/page.htm) from [School of Mathematical Sciences, Nankai University](https://math.nankai.edu.cn/).

Only a rolling stone gathers no moss.




You can find my CV here: [Jinshu's Curriculum Vitae](https://github.com/Huangjsh15/Huangjinshu.github.io/blob/master/assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
